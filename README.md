Sales Forecasting
📋 Project Overview
This project focuses on sales forecasting using machine learning models such as Random Forest and XGBoost. 
The goal is to predict sales based on various features, evaluate model performance, and analyze the importance of key features.


📊 Features of the Project
Data Preprocessing:

Handling missing values and categorical features.
Creating time-based features (Year, Month, Day, Weekday).
Encoding categorical variables (e.g., regions, shipping modes, and product categories).
Machine Learning Models:
Implementation and evaluation of Random Forest and XGBoost regressors.
Hyperparameter tuning for optimized performance.
Performance Comparison:
Comparison of model metrics: MSE (Mean Squared Error) and MAE (Mean Absolute Error).
Visualizations of real vs. predicted sales.
Feature Importance:
Analysis and visualization of the most significant features impacting sales.


🛠 Technologies Used
Python
Jupyter Notebook
Pandas
NumPy
Scikit-learn
XGBoost
Matplotlib
Seaborn


🚀 How to Run the Project
git clone https://github.com/NikitaMarshchonok/sales-forecasting.git
cd sales-forecasting


Open the Jupyter Notebook:
jupyter notebook notebook.ipynb
