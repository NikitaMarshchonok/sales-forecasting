Sales Forecasting
ðŸ“‹ Project Overview
This project focuses on sales forecasting using machine learning models such as Random Forest and XGBoost. 
The goal is to predict sales based on various features, evaluate model performance, and analyze the importance of key features.


ðŸ“Š Features of the Project
Data Preprocessing:

Handling missing values and categorical features.
Creating time-based features (Year, Month, Day, Weekday).
Encoding categorical variables (e.g., regions, shipping modes, and product categories).
Machine Learning Models:
Implementation and evaluation of Random Forest and XGBoost regressors.
Hyperparameter tuning for optimized performance.
Performance Comparison:
Comparison of model metrics: MSE (Mean Squared Error) and MAE (Mean Absolute Error).
Visualizations of real vs. predicted sales.
Feature Importance:
Analysis and visualization of the most significant features impacting sales.
